I have to say that the effectiveness of the exercises is also very much influenced by the mood of the day, and a positive or negative initial state can affect the attention being paidand efficiency of the exercises. So I have also started to record my mood evaluations before and after practice in order to better profile my emotions.
Furthermore, one of my confusions is that although this brings emotional relief and satisfaction, does it last long enough?

Because I have been studying for a long time and using my brain to a very high degree, it feels like the neurons in my brain are saturated with the connections that have been made, leaving very little room for imagination. As for the content of practice, I've had this preference for establishing pieces of the house in my head since I was little. It was more a matter of choosing my favourite pictures of housing interiors, such as design images for rooms, furniture and decorations. Then I always found the one I was most satisfied with and carefully saved them. That said, this exercise was quite familiar to me and I was able to relate it particularly well to those actions mine as a child. Although it is clear that today's exercise felt overwhelming, as brain and mind power tended to be near saturated and imagination was hindered. I would say that when I think about too many things in a day, having already made a lot of connections in the learning and thinking process, the parts left for my imagination to play with are somewhat limited. In other words, I can't really imagine what some specific house would look like, and concentrating on immersing myself in trying to come up with this house currently has some minor hindrances. But I'm sure this exercise is easy, I'm just saying it's been a bit busy lately.
A detail worth mentioning is that perhaps it's because of the connection I've built up with the kid over the last few weeks, coupled with my current state of emotional stress and anxiety, it seems that in the last few days I have returned to that fearful mental state of childhood ( although not when I was practising). I woke up one morning with a sudden recall of some of the anxiety and panic I had as a child due to fear of reprimand from parents and teachers.
